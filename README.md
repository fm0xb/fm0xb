I am currently working as junior render programmer at Ubisoft Belgrade studio. If I am not learning another graphic API or tweaking my Emacs config, I am probably hacking something just for fun. I like producing aesthetically pleasing things with algorithms and computers. I was Unix enthusiast until I got really into CG, just had to mention for good old days of Solaris and FreeBSD (I don't like Linux that much tbqh).

- Languages I work in: C++, Common Lisp, C, Rust, C#
- Technologies I work with currently: Vulkan, openFrameworks, OpenGL
- Things I am interested the most in: computer graphics and rendering, game engines, signal processing, operating systems, obscure games, weird atmospheric and moody music, futuristic aesthetics inspired by Wipeout games
